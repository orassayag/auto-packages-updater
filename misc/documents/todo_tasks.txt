REMEMBER!
=========
Each time you change the logic / update NPM package version, do the following steps:
1. Perform a backup before any change has been made, by running on terminal 'npm run backup' or manually to the backups directory.
2. After the change, check that everything works OK.
3. Keep the maintenance - Every change you do - Make sure to update in this document if needed.
4. Do commit + push on Git project repository.
5. Keep the backup update - Every change you do - Update in iOmega (each couple of days do backup there).
=================================

ToDo tasks:
===========
-Add an option to use a base path instead of each path for all the projects.
-Fix when have a bug need to break line:
-===WORKING (UPDATE): top-packages 2/2 | 100.00%===RangeError [ERR_CHILD_PROCESS_STDIO_MAXBUFFER]: stdout maxBuffer length exceeded
-Add on the console log the number of outdated packages: ===UPDATE PACKAGES (13)===
-===WORKING (UPDATE): top-packages (4) 2/2
===
-This is another project:
-Add new logic of refresh projects on github ("npm run update"):
1. List all the projects inside the projects.json file.
2. Add new property: refresh: true + Make sure new packages not checked (Keep projects acutal check as today - 12 projects updated daily).
3. Compare the size of the project between the project in github and the project locally.
4. If it's not equal - Update the github.
