REMEMBER!
=========
Each time you change the logic / update NPM package version, do the following steps:
1. Perform a backup before any change has been made, by running on terminal 'npm run backup' or manually to the backups directory.
2. After the change, check that everything works OK.
3. Keep the maintenance - Every change you do - Make sure to update in this document if needed.
4. Do commit + push on Git project repository.
5. Keep the backup update - Every change you do - Update in iOmega (each couple of days do backup there).
=================================

ToDo tasks:
===========
-Need to find a way to make all this process automatically, as the project name suggests. All git fetch and git add and git commit and git push and delete delete .git directory need to be automatically.
-Add all the projects to the source file, add new type of "maintenance" and "past".
-For other text file, just print the updates avialble for the "past" types.
