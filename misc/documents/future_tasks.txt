Future tasks:
=============
-Second step - Different scripts, same logic with a flag of true:
 1. Update the package.json file with the updated packages versions.
 2. If the package-lock.json exists, delete it.
 3. If the 'node_modules' directory exists, mark it and, and delete it.
 4. Run 'npm i', wait for the results.
 5. If success, according to the mark flag, delete again the 'node_modules' directory or keep it.
 6. Remove the last empty line (mark it as flag in settings.js) in the package.json and package-lock.json files.
 7. If failed, add to 1 to the retries, and go to the retry process: Delete the 'node_modules' directory and run 'npm i' again.
 8. If retries exceeded the limit, mark an error to the project and continue to the next project.
 9. After the NPM update packages, will verify the update by checking the package.json file again.
-In the second step, it will auto-update the package.json with the new version of the outdated NPM packages,
 and recreate the package-lock.json file, remove the last empty line of the files, remove the node_modules directory,
 and log all the updated projects.
-Check if the node_moudles directory exists, if not, create and delete it. If it is, re-create it without to delete it.
-Add the number of maximum retries on each project on settings.js. Log all the retries results.
-The output of the TXT file of the second step will look like:
